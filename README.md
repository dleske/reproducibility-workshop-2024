# Reproducible Research: Practices and Tools

Workshop at Compute Ontario Summer School, June 2024.

## Abstract

Have you ever tried to run someone else’s code and it just didn’t work? Have
you ever been lost interpreting your colleague’s data? This hands-on session
will provide researchers with tools and techniques to make their research
process more transparent and reusable in remote computing environments. We’ll
be using platforms like JupyterHub and scripting languages like Bash to
demonstrate the material. 

In this workshop, you’ll learn about:

- Organizing your file directories
- Writing readable metadata with readme files
- Automating your workflow with scripts
- Capture and share your computational environment
