# Astronaut database

The data this week comes from [Mariya Stavnichuk and Tatsuya Corlett](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/86tsnnbv2w/1). 

This [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214552420300444) talks about the data set in greater detail.

> This database contains publically available information about all astronauts who participated in space missions before 15 January 2020 collected from NASA, Roscosmos, and fun-made websites. The provided information includes full astronaut name, sex, date of birth, nationality, military status, a title and year of a selection program, and information about each mission completed by a particular astronaut such as a year, ascend and descend shuttle names, mission and extravehicular activity (EVAs) durations.

It may be interesting to also use the [Space Launches dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-01-15) from TidyTuesday 2019, week 3.

There is also a [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cumulative_spacewalk_records) on cumulative spacewalk records - you should be able to create the same dataset with the astronaut database and the `eva_hrs_mission` column.
